Let's get it (Yo)
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,
like)
Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this
(Write this, write this, write this, write this,
write)
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,
like)
Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this, yeah
(Write this, write this, write this, write this,
write)
Back when I was just a jit
hangin' on the strip (Boom)
She's the girl that I would see
in every nigga's whip (Boom)
I was much too young to truly know
what constitutes
The difference between a girl next door
and or a prostitute (Yeah)
I heard some older brothers say
they knew her from before
She lost her common sense
when niggas brought her out on tour (Yeah)
She's all about the money now,
they labeled her a whore
I heard what they was sayin',
but to me she seemed pure (Yeah)
'Cause all I seen was beauty on her face
when she would pass (Yeah)
I wanted to date her,
but there was no way for me to ask (Woof)
'Cause I was just a youngin'
and she's rippin' and a-runnin'
But I knew when I get older
that one day, we'd meet at last (Woof)
I went to college in New York,
'cause I heard she was there (Yeah)
But when I got to town,
I swear it's like she disappeared
I went to hit the Tunnel
where they said that she would hang
But when I got off the train,
I saw that it'd been closed for years (Yeah)
I showed a picture to this kid,
like, "Help me find her, yo" (Yeah)
He looked and said,
"Man, she just left a little while ago"
I saw her with some luggage
on the way to JFK
When I asked what she was doin',
she said, "Movin' to the A" (Fuck)
Movin' to the A? (Fuck)
Fuck (Fuck)
Fuck, I gotta (Fuck)
Alright, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma get up (Fuck)
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,
like)
Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this
(Write this, write this, write this, write this,

Yeah, my heart was broken,
dog, I wanted to be where she was at
But I was happy in a way,
the South was on the map (Yeah)
But niggas in the barbershop
ain't feel the same as me
They said, "Shorty changed
since she left the city,
she got whacked" (Woof)
They wanted her back,
but said it sound
like she was trapped (Woof)
They hated the slang she used,
the way her fingers snapped (Woof)
It's funny how the tables
turned several years later
These would be the same dudes
that started sayin' shit was cap
But I was still in love with her,
I couldn't hide that fact
I found her on the internet,
kept up with her like that
I sent a lot of messages,
she finally wrote me back
When I dropped the mixtape,
she said she liked the way I rap
And that was all I needed,
booked a flight and it was on
The first night I'm strikin'
like some lightnin' in a storm
The more noise she made,
it's like the better I perform
But it was more than sexual,
we had a deeper bond
Love, she's why I put my truth
into a song
For years we told each other
everythin' that's goin' on
She said, "I gotta tell ya,
I done rocked a lot of fellas
But with you there's somethin' special,
I think you could be the one" (One)
Now when it comes to love,
jealousy will often creep
That type of games is
why two of my homies started to beef
To both of them, she said,
"You're the best I ever had"
And the whole time that bitch was sayin'
that type of shit to me (Fuck)
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,
like; huh, huh)
Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this
(Write this, write this, write this, write this,
write,
gotta be somethin' for me)
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,

Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this, yeah
(Write this, write this, write this, write this,

Yeah, uh, I was naïve to believe
she was mine when I bagged her
'Cause I would come to learn
that none of us could truly have her
She was for the streets,
I'll never be her only mans
I couldn't believe it
when I seen her with an OnlyFans
When I clicked the link
inside the bio of her 'Gram
I saw a version of her
that I couldn't understand
Implants, surgically enhanced details
Poppin' Percs, mumblin'
while twerkin' BBL
I'm thinkin' this the bitch
that used to tell me, "Be yourself"
All of a sudden, for the wealth,
she's becomin' someone else
That's when I realized
as I started lookin' back
The older that she gets,
the younger she be tryna act
In fact, I'm thinkin' that's gon'
always be the case
As long as she's alive,
it's younger niggas that she'll chase
But I was in my feelings,
so I called her out of name
Like, "Bitch, you dead to me and
why the fuck you go and change?"
She screamed,
"You got the nerve to say
that I switched?
You turned me from your main thing
to your side bitch
It seemed like every day
you was blowin' kisses to me
But years went past,
now you don't even listen to me"
At first I was defensive,
bitch, listen how you sound
So many niggas fucked you,
now your pussy's watered down"
But the more I thought
about her quotes, she was right
There was a time
when she was on my phone day and night
Singin' songs to me
that I heard a time or two
Some were kind of old
and some were kind of new
But you'll see how it is gettin' older,
raisin' kids
All that spendin' time
and listenin' to her is hard to do
But, yo, I need to stop judgin'
and accept her
The problem from the start is
I was just tryna to possess her
And have her for my own,
didn't wanna let her roam
Mama said, "You should've known
she was like that when you met her" (Damn)
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,
like;
damn, she was kind of like that when I met her)
Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this
(Write this, write this, write this, write this,
write;
I guess I just couldn't see her,
I gotta love her for her)
Yeah, so I'm tryna make amends
We reminisce on old times
and play the latest trends
As long as she's alive,
I know I'll always have a friend
Thank God, I think I'm fallin'
back in love with her again
I never knew a luh-luh-luh,
a love like this
(Like this, like this, like this, like this,
like)
Gotta be somethin' for me
to write this
